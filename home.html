        <h3>Projects in Brackets</h3>
        <p>
            In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
            Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
            Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

            THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

        <samp>
            Want to see it in action? Place your cursor on the <!-- <samp> --> tag above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. You should see a CSS quick editor appear above, showing the CSS rule that
            applies to it. Quick Edit works in class and id attributes as well. You can use it with your
            LESS and SCSS files also.
            
            You can create new rules the same way. Click in one of the <!-- <p> --> tags above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. There are no rules for it right now, but you can click the New Rule
            button to add a new rule for <!-- <p> -->.
